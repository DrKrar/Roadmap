This repo is for discussions and documentations of overall and cross-repo roadmaps for JuliaQuantum projects. 
The long-term roadmap of library development for the organization is documented in [*LongTerm.md*](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/Roadmap/blob/master/LongTerm.md) and also tracked in [issue #1](#1). 
The roadmap for the on-going test-run phase is documented in [*TestRunPhaseV0.1.md*](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/Roadmap/blob/master/TestRunPhaseV0.1.md) and also tracked in issue [#2](#2). 

Discussions regarding these roadmaps are on [the issue page](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/Roadmap/issues) of this repo.
Especially, suggesting new projects, peer-reviewing of incoming packages and suggesting library coverages are highly encouraged to be posted on the issue forum. 

Discussions regarding general affairs of the JuliaQuantum organization and its official website content should go to the issue forum of the [JuliaQ/JuliaQuantum.github.io](https://github.com/JuliaQuantum/JuliaQuantum.github.io) repo.
